In this section, we examine the offline particle flow and PUPPI reconstruction algorithms.  
This is very important to understand because it benchmarks the physics performance we find in the previous section. 
We want to study the L1PFP performance with respect to its offline analogs so that we will know
the how close we are to "optimal" performance and what L1 trigger approximations cause the most performance degradation.
