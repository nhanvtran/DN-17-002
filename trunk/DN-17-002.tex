% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
This document describes the development and validation of a fast particle flow-like algorithm to be used in CMS L1 trigger applications.
The particle flow reconstruction algorithm has been successfully demonstrated at CMS.
In high pileup scenarios, the pileup per particle identification (PUPPI) algorithm, used in conjunction with particle flow, has been demonstrated to greatly mitigate the physics performance degradation from pileup.  
In this dectector performance note, we adapt these algorithms for use in a "level-1"
hardware trigger proposed for CMS during the HL-LHC runs.
We develop a simplified fast algorithm and study its physics performance with respect to other trigger algorithms and the offline reconstruction.  
We also study the feasilibity of implementing this algorithm in firmware and benchmark its performance.
